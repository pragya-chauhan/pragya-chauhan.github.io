                    <h2>Graduate Assistant, Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
                    <p>I worked at the office of International Students and Scholar Services and competently handled the front office. My duties included maintaining the internal application tracking and database system, responding to emails, answering visitor's
                        queries, answering and forwarding phone calls, creating labels for shipping and keeping a log of visitors. <br> This position helped me hone my communication, time-management, customer-relations and problem-solving skills. I also
                        worked on various office tools like G suite, Excel, Word and Outlook.</p>

                    <h2>Summer Researcher, Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
                    <p>I was selected for the Honor Research Program in the ECE department and got the opportunity to work with Prof. Kevin Lu. I developed a Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) classifier using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. Prepared data,
                        selected features, and split components to perform evaluation using a logistic regression model. The tool sucessfully categorized high-risk and low-risk patients and achieved an accuracy of 85%.

                        <br><br> Please check the website below to read all about my research.

                    <h2>Application Development Associate, Accenture</h2>
                    <p>During my time at Accenture, I went through two major trainings before starting in a project. The first one comprised of HTML, CSS, SQL, Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, SDLC. The next training was a more specific stream training
                        consisting of ETL and BI tools. I worked on various tools including Informatica Power Center, Talend, QlikView and Tableau. <br>Post clearing this training I was fortunate enough to be selected for a large project for a Fortune
                        500 client of Accenture. The technology the project employed was Salesforce and I was part of the Deployment and Architecture team and handled all Salesforce administrator and deployment activities for the Latin American and Nordic
                        organizations of the client. I regularly interacted with the client to understand the requirements and schedule environment releases and code fixes. <br>In my short tenure of one year at Accenture I was exposed to an array of technologies
                        and experienced corporate culture. I developed collaborative skills and a strong work ethic during my time there. </p>
